# Software_engineering_project  

## HOW TO RUN  
  
1. run app.py

# notice

I have written most of the HTML files and Python files at the basic level.  
Among them, login.html, register.html are perfectly completed.  
Please don't edit it as much as possible.  
What we need to do is to complete the rest except for signup/in/out.

## Create a repository in your own github and push your progress

# explain

**app.py**  
It covers the overall backend data of our project.

**product.py**  
I made an item class for trading coins.  
We recommend that you revise the relevant information here

**user.py**  
I made the data related to the members class.  
If I'm right, We won't have to edit it.
  
  
  
**style.css**  
I created tags, classes, and names to style html, and I declared them all in here



**##HTML**  
All html files inherit index.html

**index.html**  
It is a section that deals with the basic base of our website, My Page, and coin upload.  
Please do not modify this file as much as possible

**fakebank.html**  
It's a fake bank file.  
The goal will show the remaining amount of the fake bank, take as much as you enter, and update the remaining amount.  
(However, if the amount entered is more than the remaining amount, let's print an error and return to the main page.)

**product.html & product_info.html**  
html To Provide Form To Upload Coin Transactions & html To Post Coin Transactions Uploaded By Users.  
Please note that there are many areas that need to be corrected

**home.html**  
This is the first page that users encounter when they access, and I'm thinking of making this the main page.  
**Don't edit this part!!! NEVER!!!**

**login.html**  
HTML related to login(sign in).  
**Don't edit this part!!! NEVER!!!**

**register.html**  
HTML related to register(sign up).  
**Don't edit this part!!! NEVER!!!**


**WHAT WE NEED TO DO?**  
1. implement graph of coin trade changes  
2. python files ( Please edit within the given file as much as possible I don't want you to create a new file. )
